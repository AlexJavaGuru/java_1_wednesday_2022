Move out of your comfort zone.
You can only grow if you are willing to
feel awkward and uncomfortable
when you TRY SOMETHING NEW. (Brian Tracy)

Brian Tracy (born January 5, 1944) is a Canadian-American
motivational public speaker and self-development author.


Successful people do what unsuccessful people
are not willing to do. Do not wish it were easier,
wish you were better. (Jim Rohn)

Успешные люди делают то, чего не хотят делать неудачники.
Не хочу, чтобы было легче, желаю тебе быть лучше. (Джим Рон)
