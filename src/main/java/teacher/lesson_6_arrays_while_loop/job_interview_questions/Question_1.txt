Q1. What types of loops does Java support?
    Java offers three different types of loops: for, while, and do-while.

    A for loop provides a way to iterate over a range of values. It's most useful when we know in advance how many times a task is going to be repeated:

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
         // ...
    }
    A while loop can execute a block of statements while a particular condition is true:

    while (iterator.hasNext()) {
        // ...
    }
    A do-while is a variation of a while statement in which the evaluation of the boolean expression is at the bottom of the loop. This guarantees that the code will execute at least once:

    do {
        // ...
    } while (choice != -1);
