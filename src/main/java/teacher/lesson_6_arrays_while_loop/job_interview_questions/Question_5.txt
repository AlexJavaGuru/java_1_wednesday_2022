Q5. What is the difference between continue and break statement?

    Ans: break and continue are two important keywords used in Loops.
    When a break keyword is used in a loop, loop is broken instantly
    while when continue keyword is used, current iteration is broken
    and loop continues with next iteration.

    In below example, Loop is broken when counter reaches 4.

    for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++)
        System.out.println(counter);
        if (counter == 4) {
            break;
        }
    }

    In the below example when counter reaches 4,
    loop jumps to next iteration and any statements
    after the continue keyword are skipped for current iteration.

    for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++)
        System.out.println(counter);
        if (counter == 4) {
            continue;
        }
        System.out.println("This will not get printed when counter is 4");
    }
