Q4. What is an infinite Loop? How infinite loop is declared?

    Ans: An infinite loop runs without any condition and runs infinitely.
    An infinite loop can be broken by defining any breaking logic
    in the body of the statement blocks.

    Infinite loop is declared as follows:

    for (;;) {
        // Statements to execute
        // Add any loop breaking logic
    }

    while (true) {
        // Statements to execute
        // Add any loop breaking logic
    }
