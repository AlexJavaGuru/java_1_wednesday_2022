Q10. What is an Anonymous Array in Java ? Give example?

     An array without any name (or reference) is called an Anonymous Array. They are useful for the scenarios where we need one time usage of Array. For example,

     Anonymous int array :
     new int[] {2,3,4,5,6,7};

     Anonymous String array :
     new String[]{"Java", "Hungry"};
