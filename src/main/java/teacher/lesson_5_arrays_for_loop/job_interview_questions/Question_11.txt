Q11. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList ?

Array is static in size i.e of fixed length.
Size can not be changed after declaration.
ArrayList is dynamic in nature.
If you add elements to an ArrayList, it will automatically increase its size.

Array can contain both primitive and Object data types.
ArrayList does not contain primitive data types.
It only contains object entries.
