Q2. Describe the switch statement.
What object types can be used in the switch clause?

Switch allows the selection of several execution paths
based on a variables' value.

Each path is labeled with case or default,
the switch statement evaluates each case expression
for a match and executes all statements that follow
the matching label until a break statement is found.
If it can't find a match, the default block will be executed instead:

switch (yearsOfJavaExperience) {
    case 0:
        System.out.println("Student");
        break;
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Junior");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Middle");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Senior");
}

We can use byte, short, char, int, their wrapped versions,
enums and Strings as switch values.
