What is meant by Java being platform independent?

Java works on the principle of write once and run anywhere.
Once a Java program is written, it is compiled into what is known as byte code,
which can then be run on any Java Virtual Machine or JVM for short.

Compilation to bytecode is the magic behind Javaâ€™s interoperability.
Different operating systems and hardware architectures have JVMs
custom designed for themselves and all JVMs can run the same bytecode.
Therefore, if you write a Java program on Linux, it will run seamlessly
on a JVM designed for Windows operating system, making code agnostic to
the underlying hardware and OS.
