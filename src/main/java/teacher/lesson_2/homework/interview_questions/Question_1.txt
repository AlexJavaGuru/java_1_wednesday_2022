What Is The Variable?

Variable is a name which is given to a memory cell. Variable is also known as a container (or box) which is used to store data value during program execution
in memory. It is a basic unit of data storage. Variable is a combination of two words:

Vary + Able = Variable

Variable value can be changed during program execution. Here 'vary' word represent variation, it means we can change the value of a variable during
program execution.

For Example, in below code snippet, we have declared a variable number, then in next step we initialized its value and then we modi√öed its value. We will
refer below code snippet multiple time to understand variable declaration, assignment and initialization in detail in subsequent topics.

public class VariableDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // variable declaration
        int number;
        // initialization / assign a value to variable
        number = 10;
        // modify variable value and assign it again
        number = number + 20;
    }
}
