What are Primitive Literals?

Primitive Literals are the code representation of values
of primitive data types. For example 'a' is a char literal,
100 is an int literal, 'false' is a boolean literal
and 2345.456 is a double literal.

Integer Literals: Integer number types in the Java programming
language can be represented in four different ways - decimal (base 10),
octal (base 8), hexadecimal (base 16) and binary (base 2).
You will use decimal representation in most cases; and rarely,
if ever, use the other representations.

Floating-point Literals: Floating point literals are defined by
a number, followed by a decimal point and then followed by more
numbers representing the fraction. Example: 23435363.4336633.
Floating-point literals are of type double by default which
is 64 bits. If you want to assign a floating-point literal
to a float variable you have to suffix the literal with either
'F' or 'f' (like 23435363.4336633F), else you will get a
compilation error of a possible loss of precision. If you want to
assign a floating-point literal to a double variable can optionally
suffix the literal with either 'D' or 'd' (like 23435363.4336633D).
It is optional since floating-point literals are of type double by
default.

Boolean Literals: Boolean literals are code representations
of boolean data types and can be defined only as either
'true' or 'false'. Some programming languages use numbers,
usually 0 and 1, to represent boolean data type.
But in Java programming language numbers are not allowed
to represent boolean data types.

Char literals: char literals are represented by a single character in single quotes.

Example:
//Decimal literal assigned to int data type
int i1 = 200;
//Binary literal assigned to int data type
int i2 = 0B00011;
//Octal literal assigned to int data type
int i3 = 011;
//Hexadecimal literal assigned to an int data type
int i4 = 0x071ff;
//Floating-point literal assigned to float data type
float f = 23435.45637F;
//Floating-point literal, with explicit suffix, assigned to double data type
double d = 43536376.3455365D
//Floating-point literal, without explicit suffix, assigned to double data type
double d1 = 4253636.4536;
//Character literal assigned to char data type
char c = 'a';
//Boolean literal assigned to boolean data type
boolean b = true;
