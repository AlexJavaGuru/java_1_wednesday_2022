What is local variable?

A variable declared inside method, block or loop is known as local variable.

Their scope or visibility is local to the entity in which
they are declared. They cannot be used outside these entity.

A local variable should be initialized before use otherwise
compiler error will occur.

Important points related to java local variable.

Scope of the java local variables is restricted
to the method/constructor in which it is created.
They are not accessible outside the method.

Java local variables are not assigned any default value.
If you fail to assign it a value then while using it compiler
will give error.
Say for example, int x; Then if you write System.out.println(x);
you will get compiler error at x in print
statement - "local variable x may not have been initialized".

public class LocalVariable {

            public static void main(String[] args) {

                        int a = 10;    //var a local to main method
                        int res = a+1;  //var res local to main method

                        System.out.println(b);

            }

}


Trying to access local variables outside the java method

public class LocalVariable {

            public static void main(String[] args) {

                  int a = 10;    //var a local to main method
                  int res = a+1;  //var res local to main method

                  System.out.println(b);
            }

           public void methodA(){
                 int b =20;
                 int add = a + b;   //compilation error
           }
}

Local variable cannot be accessed or used outside the method in which it is declared.

This is why we are not able to use value of variable 'a' outside main() method and got compile time error in methodA.
