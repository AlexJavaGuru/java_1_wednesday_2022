Why Is Specifying DataType Mandatory In Java?

Data type of a variable is an attribute which tells what kind of data that variable can have. Every java variable takes up a certain amount of space in
memory. How much memory a variable takes is depends on its datatype.

For Example, As we see in our daily life, Different types of vehicle requires different amount of space in your parking area. For example, Our two wheeler
may require two blocks where as Car may require 6 blocks of space. Same applies to variables in java. Storing a small number requires less space compared
to large number. So, we need to declare a datatype of our variable accordingly.

In other words, data types are used by JVM to assign space for that variable in the memory. If we do not specify datatype, JVM can not decide how much
space is required by that variable during program execution. So, it is mandatory to use datatype before variable name and Java Compiler will cry, if you miss
to do that.

Java has two types of datatype primitive and non-primitive data type.
