What are wrapper classes in Java programming language?

There are many cases where we cannot directly use primitive data types.
For example, We cannot put primitives into Java collections since
Java collections (Lists, Sets etc.) can only store objects.

Wrapper classes are classes provided by java programming language
that enable us to wrap primitive data in Objects. Each of the
eight primitive data types has a corresponding Wrapper class as
listed in below table.

Primitive Data Type	        Wrapper Class
byte	                    Byte
short	                    Short
int	                        Integer
double	                    Double
long	                    Long
float	                    Float
char	                    Character
boolean	                    Boolean

Example:

class MyClass {
  //List of Integers
  List<Integer> list = new ArrayList();
  //Add ints 1-50 to the list
  public void addToList() {
    for (int i=1; i<=50; i++) {
      //Convert to Integer object and add to list
      list.add(Integer.valueOf(i));
    }
  }
}
