Q1. Describe the if-then and if-then-else statements.
What types of expressions can be used as conditions?

Both statements tell our program to execute the code
inside of them only if a particular condition evaluates to true.
However, the if-then-else statement provides a secondary path
of execution in case the if clause evaluates to false:

if (age >= 21) {
    // ...
} else {
    // ...
}

Unlike other programming languages, Java only supports
boolean expressions as conditions.
If we try to use a different type of expression,
we'll get a compilation error.
