Q3. What happens when we forget to put
a break statement in a case clause of a switch?

The switch statement falls-trough.
This means that it will continue the execution
of all case labels until if finds a break statement,
even though those labels don't match the expression's value.

Here's an example to demonstrate this:

int operation = 2;
int number = 10;

switch (operation) {
    case 1:
        number = number + 10;
        break;
    case 2:
        number = number - 4;
    case 3:
        number = number / 3;
    case 4:
        number = number * 10;
        break;
}

After running the code, number holds the value 20, instead of 6.
This can be useful in situations when we want to associate the
same action with multiple cases.
