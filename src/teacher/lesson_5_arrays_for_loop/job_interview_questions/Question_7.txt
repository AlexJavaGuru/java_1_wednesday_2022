Q7. Advantages and disadvantages of Array?

    Advantages:

    We can put in place other data structures like stacks, queues,
    linked lists, trees, graphs, etc. in Array.
    Arrays can sort multiple elements at a time.
    We can access an element of Array by using an index.

    Disadvantages:

    We have to declare Size of an array in advance.
    However, we may not know what size we need at the time of array declaration.
    The array is static structure. It means array size is always fixed,
    so we cannot increase or decrease memory allocation.
