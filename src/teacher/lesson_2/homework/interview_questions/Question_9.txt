What is Primitive Casting in Java programming language?

Primitive Casting is used to convert primitive values from
one data type to another. For example, an int value can be
assigned to a float data type, or a double value can be
assigned to an int data type. Casting can be either implicit or explicit.

Implicit Casting: In implicit casting the conversion happens
automatically, without writing specific code to do the conversion.
Implicit casting happens when you convert or assign a smaller value,
like a byte, to a larger data type such as an int.

Explicit Casting: In explicit casting code has to be specifically
written to perform the conversion from one primitive type to another.
Explicit casting is done by using the syntax (data_type) where
data_type is the data type that the cast is being applied to.
Explicit casting happens when you convert or assign a larger
value to a smaller data type.

Example:
//Implicit cast - smaller value is assigned to bigger data type
int i = 200;
long l = i;

//Explicit cast - larger value assigned to smaller data type
float f = 234.345f;
int i = (int)f;
