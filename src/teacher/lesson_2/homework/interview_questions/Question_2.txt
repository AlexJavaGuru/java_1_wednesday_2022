How To Declare A Variable In Java?

Declaring a variable is very easy. If you have noticed in above example, we have declared variable number on line 6. But along with that we have also
specified its datatype i.e. int.

Below code snippet shows some more example of variable declaration.

int number;
boolean flag;
String name;

Here number, flag and name are variable name and int, boolean and String are their respective data types.
Java is known as strictly typed language as it is mandatory to specify a data type of a variable before variable name. in java. It is used by compiler to help
programmer avoid any mistakes such as storing String values to integer variables.
